# Algorithms and Data Structures - Mini Projects
CS5112 Algorithms and Data Structures for Applications - Cornell Tech

This is a compilation of few different Algorithms and Data Structures mini projects that I completed in a team with Sachi Angle for the CS5112 course at Cornell Tech, NYC. Developed in Python.

Some solutions are not publicly available as requested by the professors. If interested in knowing more about these projects you can contact me at if76@cornell.edu.
